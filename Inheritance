// Imagine that you need to code a Train class.
class Train {}

// In between the curly braces, the first piece of code that you need to define is the constructor:
class Train {
    constructor() {

    }
}


// For now, let's say that there are only two properties that each object instance of the Train class should have at the time it gets instantiated: color and lightsOn.
class Train {
    constructor(color, lightsOn) {
        this.color = color;
        this.lightsOn = lightsOn;
    }
}


// Now, to actually build a new instance of the Train class
new Train()


// Putting it all together, here's your first train:
var myFirstTrain = new Train('red', false);


// console log the myFirstTrain object:
console.log(myFirstTrain); // Train {color: 'red', lightsOn: false}
var mySecondTrain = new Train('blue', false);
var myThirdTrain = new Train('blue', false);
