// Imagine that you need to code a Train class.
class Train {}

// In between the curly braces, the first piece of code that you need to define is the constructor:
class Train {
    constructor() {

    }
}


// For now, let's say that there are only two properties that each object instance of the Train class should have at the time it gets instantiated: color and lightsOn.
class Train {
    constructor(color, lightsOn) {
        this.color = color;
        this.lightsOn = lightsOn;
    }
}


// Now, to actually build a new instance of the Train class
new Train()
