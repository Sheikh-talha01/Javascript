 // learn how the for of loop works conceptually.

//  it's important to know that a for of loop cannot work on an object directly, since an object is not iterable. 
//For example:
const car = {
    speed: 100,
    color: "blue"
}

for(prop of car) {
    console.log(prop)
}
// Running the above code snippet will throw the following error
//      Uncaught TypeError: car is not iterable



//  Contrary to objects, arrays are iterable. For example:  
const colors = ['red','orange','yellow']
for (var color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
//This time, the output is as follows
// red
// orange
// yellow
